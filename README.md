TiKTrump is a small application to show the stupidest things that the orange man has said.

This project was made to try learn a bit more about the new Android Components and have an
up to date tech stack.

## Overview
 * 100% Kotlin
 * Modern Architecture (MVVM)
 * Makes use of some Jetpack Components (LiveData, Room, ViewModel)
 * Hilt for DI

## Future Plan
  * Allow refreshing
  * Add another server call to display a random quote
  * Add another server call to display a customized quote
  * Add favorites
  * Add in Giphy support to get random Trump gifs instead of having locally sourced gifs
